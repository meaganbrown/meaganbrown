### What am I up to? 

👩🏻‍💻📊 Using Python and ArcgisPro at [Pathways Climate Institute](https://www.pathwaysclimate.com/about) to understand how groundwater, sea level rise, and precipitation are changing in response to climate change. 

### R Experience
- **Spring 2023:** Text Sentiment Analysis (Used R for text processing, classification, semantics, and natural language parsing)
- **Spring 2023:** Modeling Environmental Systems (Used R to develop static, dynamic and spatial models)
- **Winter 2022:** Environmental Policy Evaluation (Used R to measure the causal effect of policies on environmental outcomes of interest)
- **Winter 2022:** Machine Learning (Used R to process big/complex data and extract knowledge)
- **Fall   2022:** Statistics for Environmental Data Science (Used R to determine if there is a statistically significant relationship between groundwater levels and fire size in California) 
- **Summer 2022:** Introduction to R masters course (Learned basics of R and GitHub)
- **2021 - 2022:** SGMA GSP Reviewer & Mapper (Used R to produce histograms for well depth distributions across CA groundwater basins)
- **Winter 2021:** Exploring Water Data (Big Data Wrangling & Visualization in R)
- **2020 - 2021:** Environmental Studies Senior thesis (Created maps of California groundwater basins in R for my project)
- **Summer 2020:** Geographic Information Systems Introduction (GIS applications in R)

### Python Experience
- **September 2023 - Present:** Working with [Pathways Climate Institute](https://www.pathwaysclimate.com/about) on various climate change projects. 
- **May 16 - May 18 2023:** Data Analysis and Visualization in Python Workshop (Cleaned & Created Visualizations in Python)
- **Fall   2022:** Environmental Data (Used python and google earth engine for environmental data analysis)
- **Summer 2022:** Python for Environmental Data Science (Introduced to Python)

### Education

- MEDS (2022): Master of Environmental Data Science (Bren School of Environmental Science & Management - UC Santa Barbara)
- BS (2021): Environmental Studies (UC Santa Barbara)

### Additional Experience
💧 Worked with the Public Policy Institute of California's [Water Policy Center](https://www.ppic.org/water/about-the-center/) to assess groundwater recharge efforts in the San Joaquin Valley <br>
💧 Gathered public water supply data across the US for 780 cities to determine how much of each cities water supply is from groundwater vs other sources.
